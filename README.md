Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing multiple users to collaborate on projects efficiently. It helps track revisions, manage different versions of code, and enables easy rollback to previous states. By maintaining a comprehensive history of modifications, version control enhances collaboration, ensures data integrity, and simplifies project management.
